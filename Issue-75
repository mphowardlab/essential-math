Example: Spring and dashpot 
This is a mechanics example, but models like this we also used for the rheology of viscoelastic materials 

m(x'') + gamma(x') + kx = 0 
m(x'') = accumulation 
gamma(x') = drag 
kx = spring force 

When will the spring oscillate? 
m(lambda^2) + gamma(lambda) + k = 0 --> lambda12 = (-gamma+sqrt((gamma^2)-4mk))/(2m) or (-gamma-sqrt((gamma^2)-4mk))/(2m)

If 4mk> (gamma^2), lambda12 will be complex and you will get oscillations

lambda12 = (-gamma/(2m)) + (i/(2m))(sqrt(4mk-(gamma^2))) or (-gamma/(2m)) - (i/(2m))(sqrt(4mk-(gamma^2))) 
y(t) = (exp((-gamma/(2m)(t))))(C1cos(wt)+C2sin(wt))

What does gamma do to the solution? 
- Damps the oscillations to decay to zero. Without it, oscillations go on forever and are always present
- Changes frequency of oscillations

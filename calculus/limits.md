# Limits
**Formal Defitinition**
/begin{equation}
lim_{x->x_{0}} = f(x) = l
/end{equation}
if for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all x, if 0 < |x-x₀| < δ the |f(x)-L| < ε.
~ ε is a "tolerance" -> how close does f need to be to L?
~ Given any ε, need to find a "window" of x values within δ of x₀ so that f stays within ε of L.

# Limits
**Formal Defitinition**

\begin{equation}
lim_{x \rightlongarrow x₀} = f(x) = l
\end{equation}

if for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all x, if 0 < |x-x₀| < δ the |f(x)-L| < ε.

~ ε is a "tolerance" \rightlongarrow how close does f need to be to L?

~ Given any ε, need to find a "window" of x values within δ of x₀ so that f stays within ε of L.

If ε = 1, 3 < f < 5 if 3 < x < 5, ie. δ = 1.
    For any ε, 4 - ε < f < 4 + ε if 
            4 - δ < x < 4 + δ
        \rightlongarrow |x - 4| < ε , |x-4| < δ 
            δ = ε
put image here

Hence, 
\begin{equation}
lim_{x \rightlongarrow 4} = 4
\end{equation}

Such a 8 cannot always be found for all ε for certain functions! There, the limit does not exist.

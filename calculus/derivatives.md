# Derivatives
3. Differentiability 

To be differentiable, this limit must exist. A function would not be differentiable at a jump, cusp, coner, or vertical tangent

4. Higher order derivatives

Differentiating f' gives f'', the second derivative. This process can be repeated for higher order(e.g. third) derivatives.

Example:

$$f(x)=x^2, f'(x)=2x$$

\begin{align}
f''(x)=lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}} \\
&= lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{(2(x+h)-2x)}{h}} \\
&= lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{2h}{2}} \\
= 2
\end{align}

The second derivative tells us how to find the first derivative changes.

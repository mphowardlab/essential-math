# Series Expansion
- Nonlinear functions can be nasty, but polynomials are the "nicest" version.
    - *How can we turn a general, nonlinear equation into a polynomial?*

## Taylor Series
- Suppose we have some function $f(x)$ that we want to approximate as a **power series**:

  $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n(x-x_0)^n = c_0 + c_1(x-x_0) + c_2(x-x_0)^2 + c_3(x-x_0)^3 ...$

  - What is $f(x_0)$?
      - $f(x_0) = c_0$
  - What is $f'(x_0)$?

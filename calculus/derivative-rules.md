Physics example: harmonic oscillator

\begin{align}
F=-kx
\end{align}

\begin{align}
x(t)=x(0)\cos{{2 \pi t} / T} 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
T = {1/2 \pi}{\sqrt{m/k}}

How fast is the oscillator moving?

\begin{align}
(unsure abt this part- ask for clarification) V(t) x(1/4) = =x(0)\sin(u)u' MORE MATH
\end{align}

When is the oscillator moving *fastest*?

A function is at an *extrema* when its derivative is zero. If the function is velocity, this is
\begin{equation}
a=v'=0
\end{equation}
i.e., it's not accelerating!

MORE MATH

This is when
\begin{equationn}
x(t)=0  
\end{equation}
and the spring is not stretched!

Under these conditions, all of the potential energy is kinetic energy.

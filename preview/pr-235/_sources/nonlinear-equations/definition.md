# Definition

Nonlinear equations are those that cannot be written in the form $Ax = b$.
Such equations come up in many places

- Equations of state $P(T, V) \rightarrow$ thermodynamics
- Navier-Stokes equations $\rightarrow$ fluid mechanics
- Second-order reactions $A + B \rightarrow C$ $r_A = -kC_AC_B \rightarrow$ reactions
- Optimization/process design of full systems $\rightarrow$ design

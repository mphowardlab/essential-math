# Laplace transform
{.bg-primary}
The Laplace transform is used in signals and controls. \
It is also a way to solve **differential** equations using **algebra**. \ 
It is defined as: \ 
F(s) = **L** = \int e^-st=\exp(-st) \cdot f(t)dt



{.bg-primary}
The inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is f(t)!

Many Laplace transforms are already known, but can be computed using integration by parts.

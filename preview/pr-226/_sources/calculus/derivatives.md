# Derivatives
3. Differentiability 

To be differentiable, this limit must exist. A function would not be differentiable at a jump, cusp, coner, or vertical tangent

4. Higher order derivatives

Differentiating f' gives f'', the second derivative. This process can be repeated for higher order(e.g. third) derivatives.

Example:

$$f(x)=x^2, f'(x)=2x$$

$$f''(x)=lim(h->0)(f'(x+h)-f'(x))/h = lim(h->0)(2(x+h)-2x)/h = lim(h->0)2h/2 = 2$$

The second derivative tells us how to find the first derivative changes.

# Homogeneous linear second-order ODEs with constant coefficients
1. Homogenous linear second-order ODEs with constant coefficients
***
Equations of the form

{math}`y'' + ay' + by = 0`

come up often so it is important to know how to solve them!
  * Mechanics
  * Heat/Mass Diffusion (steady)
  * Solving partial differential equations for unsteady processes

Solution: Try y=e^x as an ansatz
    y = e^\lambdax
    y' = \lambda e^



y=e^{\lambda x}

# Matrix inversion
Gauss-Jordan elimination works well for solving (\underline{A}) (\underline{x}) = (\underline{b}) but the process needs to be repeated for every new (\underline{b}).

Is there an alternative if we need to solve (\underline{A}) (\underline{x}) = (\underline{b}) for many different (\underline{b})

(\underline{matrix inverse}). For a square (nxn) matrix (\underline{A}), the inverse (\underline{A})

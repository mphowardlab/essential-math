# Systems of linear equations
Linear systems come up often in mass balances (process design)

\begin{equation}
a_{11}x_{1} + ... + a_{1n}x_{n} = b_{1}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
a_{m1}x_{1} + ... + a_{mn}x_{n} = b_{n}
\end{equation}


Unknowns: 
\begin{equation}
x_{1}, ..., x_{n} (n)
\end{equation}

Coefficients:
\begin{equation}
 a_{mn} (mxn)
 \end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & ... & a_{1n} \\ ... &     & ... \\ a_{m1} & ... & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \ x_{1} \\ ... \\ x_{n} \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} b_{1} \\ ... \\ b_{m} \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

**Ax = b**

**A system of linear equations can have:**
- No Solution (Inconsistent Equations)
- One Solution
- Infinitely many solutions (undetermined)

Ex: Graph the following and explain how many solutions exist. Then, solve the equations if possible.

A homogeneous solution, Ax=0, **always** has at least the trivial solution x = 0. We will discuss how to systematically solve these

# Laplace transform
3. Example: Hormone Level \
The concentration of a hormone in the blood varies due to sinusoidal production by the thyroid and continuous removal according to: \
c' = A + Bcos((\pi t)/12) - kc  \
The concentration is c_0 at 6 AM (t = 0). What is the average concentration between 6 PM and 6 AM the same day? \
To solve, rearrange and use the Laplace transform \
c' + kc = A + Bcos((\pi t)/12) \

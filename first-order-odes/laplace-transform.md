# Laplace transform

The Laplace transform is used in signals and controls. It is also a way to solve differential equations using algebra. It is defined as:




The inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is f(t)!

Many Laplace transforms are already known, but can be computed using integration by parts.














Remember from integration by parts lecture

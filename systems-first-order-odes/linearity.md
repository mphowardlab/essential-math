# Linearity

A system of first-oder ODEs is linear if \begin{equation} y' = A(t)y + g(t) \end{equation}

Linear systems have unique solutions and special properties we will discuss
later.

An important special case is the homogeneous linear system with constant
coefficients \begin{equation} y' = Ay \end{equation}

We will focus on solving these types of problems because they come up a lot in
chemical engineering problems and future courses (e.x. controls).

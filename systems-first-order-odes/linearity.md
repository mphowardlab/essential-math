# Linearity

A system of first-oder ODEs is linear if:

\begin{equation}
\vv{y}' = A(t) \vv{y} + g(t)
\end{equation}

Linear systems have unique solutions and special properties we will discuss
later.

An important special case is the homogeneous linear system with constant
coefficients:

\begin{equation} \vv{y}' = A \vv{y}
\end{equation}

We will focus on solving these types of problems because they come up a lot in
chemical engineering problems and future courses (e.x. controls).

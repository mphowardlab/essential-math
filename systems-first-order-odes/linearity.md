# Linearity

A system of first-oder ODEs is linear if y' = A(t)y + g(t).

Linear systems have unique solutions and special properties we will discuss
later.

An important special case is the homogeneous linear system with constant
coefficients y' = A*y.

We will focus on solving these types of problems because they come up a lot in
chemical engineering problems and future courses (e.x. controls).
